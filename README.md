# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe – Java Swing

## 📌 Overview

This is a desktop Tic Tac Toe game built using **Java** and **Swing GUI components**.  
The game allows two players to play against each other on the same computer. The first turn is selected randomly, and the game automatically detects winning combinations.

This project was built to practice **event-driven programming**, **GUI design**, and **core Java fundamentals**.
